                        <h3>What is Color Theory?</h3>
                        <p>Color theory explains how colors interact, combine, and contrast. It is essential for
                            creating visually appealing and effective designs, as it helps designers choose harmonious
                            color combinations and understand the impact of color choices.</p>

                        <h3>The Color Wheel</h3>
                        <p>The color wheel consists of primary (red, blue, yellow), secondary (green, orange, purple),
                            and tertiary colors. Common color schemes include complementary (opposite colors), analogous
                            (adjacent colors), triadic (three evenly spaced colors), and split-complementary (a base
                            color and two adjacent to its complement).</p>

                        <h3>Color Psychology</h3>
                        <p>Colors evoke emotions: blue suggests trust, red signals passion, and green represents growth.
                            Understanding color psychology helps in crafting messages and branding that resonate with
                            audiences.</p>

                            emotional impact. Strategic color choices improve user experience and brand recognition.</p>
